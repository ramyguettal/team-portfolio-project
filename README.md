# 🧑‍💻 Team Portfolio Project

This repository contains the **Team Portfolio Website** developed as part of our **Software Engineering** course project.  
It showcases the profiles of all team members and demonstrates collaboration using **GitHub’s branch-based workflow**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to collaboratively build a responsive, static website that presents our team members, their skills, and contributions.

The project is hosted using **GitHub Pages**, and the workflow follows a **feature-branch → develop → main** structure for clean and organized development.

## 🌿 Branching Strategy

We use a **three-level branch system**:

| Branch | Purpose |
|--------|----------|
| `main` | Production branch – always stable and ready for deployment |
| `develop` | Integration branch – where all features are merged and tested |
| `feature/<feature-name>` | Individual feature branches for each member’s work |
